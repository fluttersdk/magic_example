    | Billing
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    |
    | The package ships the entitlement CONTRACT, not a payment rail: the two
    | neutral enums, the provenance columns, and the one action that arbitrates
    | between rails writing the same tier. Your own rail (Cashier, a store SDK,
    | an operator command) feeds it.
    |
    | 'billable' is WHICH KIND of thing you bill, and it accepts exactly two
    | values: 'user' or 'team'. It is a closed token rather than a model class
    | name deliberately, because the package has to know what kind of subject it
    | is writing to and a class name cannot say (an App\Models\Account could be
    | either). The class itself still comes from the 'models' block above, so a
    | published App\Models\Team or your own user model is picked up unchanged.
    |
    | The default is 'user' because the teams feature ships OFF: on a fresh
    | install there is no team to bill, not even a personal one. Selecting 'team'
    | therefore REQUIRES the teams feature, and the provider refuses to boot
    | rather than letting an entitlement be written to a subject that does not
    | exist. Any other PRESENT value, including an explicit null, is refused at
    | boot for the same reason. Leaving the key out entirely is not: an older
    | published config has no key at all, and 'user' is the answer for it.
    |
    | 'tier_order' is your plan catalogue, CHEAPEST FIRST. The tier vocabulary
    | belongs to your application, so this package never guesses it; list your
    | own plan ids in the order a customer upgrades through them.
    |
    | WritesEntitlement uses this list for exactly one decision: whether an
    | incoming write from a DIFFERENT billing rail than the one on record would
    | leave the billable holding LESS than it holds now. Such a write is
    | dropped, because a rail may only revoke what it granted.
    |
    | Leaving the list empty makes that comparison undecidable, and an
    | undecidable cross-rail write against a tier the billable HOLDS is REFUSED,
    | with a warning naming this key. A billable holding nothing is a separate
    | case and is unaffected: there is no tier to take away, so such a write
    | applies whether or not this list is published. So the empty default is
    | safe for a fresh install and is not safe once you sell something on more
    | than one rail: publish the order then.
    |
    | 'plans' is the CATALOGUE the billing screen renders: one entry per tier,
    | cheapest first, served verbatim under a 'data' envelope by
    | GET billing/plans. It is display data and gating data, never Stripe price
    | ids (those are 'prices' below).
    |
    | 'prices' maps a Stripe price id onto the tier AND the cycle it sells. A
    | tier is not a price: sold monthly and annually it is two, and the checkout
    | asks for a (tier, cycle) pair so the customer is charged the figure the
    | screen showed them. A bare value ('price_x' => 'pro') names the tier and is
    | read as MONTHLY, which is a guess this package cannot verify, so declare
    | ['tier' => ..., 'cycle' => ...] on anything that is not monthly or every
    | screen will report the wrong interval over a real charge.
    |
    | THE FIRST ENTRY MATCHING A (tier, cycle) PAIR WINS, in the order written
    | here. The old shape had one entry per tier by construction and this one
    | invites several: the realistic case is a grandfathered price kept mapped so
    | its webhooks still grant the tier, and new checkouts then go to whichever
    | of the two is listed higher, silently. List the price you want SOLD first
    | and keep retired ones below it.
    |
    | The package names only the fields every billing screen needs: 'id', 'name',
    | 'tagline', 'monthly', 'annual', 'currency', 'features', 'recommended', plus
    | 'cycles', which is RESERVED and derived: the endpoint computes it from the
    | price map below and overwrites whatever an entry carries under that key, so
    | do not write one. Every other key you put on an entry travels to the client
    | UNTOUCHED, which is where anything product-specific belongs: what a tier
    | caps, what it unlocks, the copy for a capability only your product has.
    | This package cannot know those and does not try, exactly as it delegates
    | counting to ReportsUsage and the tier vocabulary to the list below. A null
    | price means "contact us"; what a null LIMIT means is your application's
    | business, not this package's.
    |
    | A bullet in 'features' is a promise made to somebody holding a credit card,
    | so it may only name something that works today.
    |
    | ORDER AND RANKING. When 'tier_order' below is published it is the ranking,
    | full stop, and this catalogue is only display. When it is NOT published the
    | order is taken from these entries' ids instead, so an adopter who publishes
    | one list gets both behaviours rather than a working screen beside an
    | undecidable cross-rail write. Publishing both and having them disagree
    | means the explicit list wins, because it is the more specific declaration;
    | there is no reason to write two orders, so write one.
    |
    | 'prices' is which Stripe PRICE sells which tier ON WHICH CYCLE, in either
    | of the two forms described above: a bare 'price_id' => 'tier_id' string,
    | read as MONTHLY, or the explicit ['tier' => ..., 'cycle' => ...] entry. The
    | Stripe rail reads it in both directions: a webhook asks which tier and
    | cycle the price on a subscription sells, and a checkout asks which price
    | sells the (tier, cycle) pair the customer picked.
    |
    | It lives here rather than under cashier.plans, which is where an earlier
    | application kept it. That key is NOT part of Cashier: Cashier's own config
    | has no 'plans' key at all, so an adopter following Cashier's documentation
    | would never create one, every price would resolve to no tier, and no
    | webhook would ever grant anything, with no error anywhere to say why.
    |
    | 'store_products' is the same question for the STORE rail: which App Store
    | or Play product sells which tier, as a ['product_id' => 'tier_id'] map. The
    | store rail cannot grant anything until it is filled, and an unmapped
    | product is logged and written nowhere, which is the direction that cannot
    | hand out a tier nobody bought.
    |
    | KEY IT ON THE WHOLE PRODUCT ID GOOGLE SENDS. Play reports a subscription as
    | '<subscription_id>:<base_plan_id>', so a map keyed on the bare subscription
    | id misses on every Android renewal and warns instead of granting. Apple
    | sends the plain product id and needs no such care.
    |
    | An unmapped price is a CONFIG GAP and never a downgrade: a rail that cannot
    | name the tier a paying subscription sells leaves the entitlement alone and
    | warns, because the alternative is taking a tier away from somebody whose
    | card just cleared.
    |
    | Assembling this from the environment is the normal case
    | (env('CASHIER_PRICE_PRO') and friends), and it is also how the dangerous
    | entry appears: an unset variable writes an EMPTY KEY, and an empty key that
    | reached a reverse lookup would name the empty string as the price that
    | sells a paid tier. Empty keys and empty tiers are therefore stripped when
    | this map is read, so leaving a variable unset costs you one tier that
    | cannot be sold rather than one that is given away.
    |
    | WHY laravel/cashier IS A HARD REQUIRE. It is the one dependency in this
    | package that needed an argument. The four SDKs already in the require
    | block (Sanctum, Socialite, google2fa, OneSignal) are libraries: they cost
    | an adopter nothing until something resolves them. Cashier is a package
    | with a service provider, and CashierServiceProvider::boot() runs for every
    | adopter whether or not they bill, registering the stripe/webhook route
    | under config('cashier.path'), merging a cashier config, and adding a
    | vendor:publish group.
    |
    | Cashier::ignoreRoutes() is what makes that acceptable. The provider calls
    | it from register() under the billing feature gate, which is the only phase
    | early enough: every provider's register() runs before any provider's
    | boot(), so by the time Cashier boots the refusal is already in place. With
    | billing on, the package serves the webhook under a key of its own and
    | Cashier's route never appears; with billing off, nothing here touches
    | Cashier and an adopter driving it directly keeps their own routes.
    |
    | The publish group is the one residual cost and it cannot be vetoed in
    | code: addPublishGroup() is additive and Laravel exposes no removal, so
    | Cashier's groups stay listed under vendor:publish.
    |
    | THE STRIPE WEBHOOK KEEPS CASHIER'S PATH AND CASHIER'S SECRET, and both are
    | deliberate exceptions to the package-owned-key rule 'prices' follows above.
    |
    | The package serves the webhook itself (src/routes/webhooks.php, loaded from
    | its own loadRoutesFrom under the billing feature), and it registers the
    | route under config('cashier.path'), which defaults to 'stripe'. So the
    | served path is `stripe/webhook`: exactly what Cashier serves, exactly what
    | an adopter arriving from Cashier already has in their Stripe dashboard.
    | That file is separate from src/routes/api.php because nothing here may
    | inherit 'route_prefix' above: an API prefix moves with a deploy, and a
    | webhook URL registered in a vendor dashboard cannot, so inheriting it would
    | 404 every delivery until somebody edited the dashboard by hand.
    |
    | config('cashier.webhook.secret') stays Cashier's key for a stricter reason
    | than convention: Cashier's own WebhookController::__construct() is what
    | reads it, and it attaches the signature middleware only when it is set.
    | Moving it under a package key would leave that constructor reading an empty
    | value and would silently UNSIGN the endpoint. 'prices' moved precisely
    | because the opposite is true of it: 'cashier.plans' was never a Cashier key
    | at all, so nothing in Cashier reads it.
    |
    | DO NOT RUN `vendor:publish --tag=cashier-migrations`. That is the residual
    | cost turning into a broken schema, and it is the one instruction here that
    | can only be written down. Cashier's five migrations hardcode
    | Schema::table('users'), $table->id() and foreignId('user_id'): on an
    | application billing a team they put the Stripe customer columns on the
    | wrong table, and on any application using UUID keys they create a bigint
    | `subscriptions` whose child `subscription_items` cannot reference it. The
    | package ships its own three in place of those five
    | (add_cashier_customer_columns_to_billable_table, create_subscriptions_table
    | and create_subscription_items_table), resolving the table from 'billable'
    | and the key type from 'use_uuids', with Cashier's two later meter columns
    | folded into the items create. `magic-starter:install` publishes them in
    | dependency order.
    |
    | USAGE REPORTING has no key here, because it has no default to hold: the
    | package ships FlutterSdk\MagicStarter\Contracts\ReportsUsage with
    | deliberately NO default implementation and NO binding, and the usage
    | endpoint it would feed is registered only once a consumer binds one
    | (typically `$this->app->bind(ReportsUsage::class, ...)` in the
    | consumer's own AppServiceProvider). Binding a default here would answer
    | an empty usage map for every billable until the consumer wires real
    | counting, and an empty map is not "unknown", it is "used nothing": every
    | cap a consumer gates on that answer would silently open. See the
    | contract's own docblock for the shipped defect this refusal exists to
    | prevent.
    |
    | UPGRADING FROM A RELEASE BEFORE 'billable' EXISTED. Set this key
    | EXPLICITLY before re-running the installer, even to the value you believe
    | is already in effect. mergeConfigFrom is a shallow merge, so a config
    | published before the key existed carries no 'billable' at all and the
    | 'user' default answers for it. That is correct for the arbitration
    | contract, and it is wrong for the SCHEMA of an application billing a team:
    | the four migrations above resolve their target through
    | MagicStarter::billableModel(), so a team-billing application that upgrades
    | without setting the key gets a whole Cashier schema plus the entitlement
    | provenance on `users` instead of `teams`. Nothing refuses it, and nothing
    | can: the boot guard only rejects a token it does not RECOGNISE, and 'user'
    | is a perfectly valid one. Before the Cashier tables shipped this cost one
    | mis-targeted ALTER; it now costs the whole billing schema.
    |
    | 'revenuecat' configures the STORE rail: Apple App Store and Google Play
    | subscriptions, reaching the application as webhook deliveries that are
    | only ever a SIGNAL. What a subscriber is actually entitled to is read
    | back from RevenueCat's API by
    | \FlutterSdk\MagicStarter\Support\RevenueCatClient, so both halves of the
    | rail need configuration here: the secret that authenticates an inbound
    | delivery, and the key that authenticates the outbound read.
    |
    | It lives under a PACKAGE-OWNED key rather than under 'cashier', because
    | RevenueCat has no Laravel vendor package at all here: there is no default
    | to defer to and no adopter dashboard that already points at some other
    | path, unlike the Stripe webhook, which keeps reading Cashier's own
    | 'cashier.path'.
    |
    | The five SECRET AND TUNING ENV VAR NAMES below are NOT this package's to
    | rename, even though the config key that reads them is. An adopter migrating
    | from a hand-rolled RevenueCat integration already has these set on their
    | server, and keeping the names means adopting this package is a config-file
    | change rather than a server .env edit with a window where deliveries fail.
    |
    | 'path' is the WHOLE served path of the inbound webhook, and its default is
    | constrained by the same fact: `webhooks/revenuecat` is the path the
    | application this rail was extracted from already serves and already has
    | registered in the RevenueCat dashboard. A webhook URL cannot move with a
    | deploy, so any other default would make adopting this package a manual
    | dashboard edit with a window in which every delivery 404s. Change it only
    | when you are changing the dashboard in the same breath.
    |
    | THE ROUTE IS WITHHELD ON A HALF-CONFIGURED RAIL. When the store rail is
    | configured (an API key or a store product map) and 'webhook_secret' is not,
    | the endpoint could not authenticate anybody, so it is not registered at all:
    | the provider logs the reason once at boot and `magic-starter:install`
    | refuses to complete. The application keeps serving; only the store rail is
    | held back, because an endpoint that refuses every delivery would spend
    | RevenueCat's five retries on a configuration no retry can fix.
    |
    | BOTH SECRETS ARE EMPTY BY DEFAULT AND THE RAIL FAILS CLOSED ON EITHER.
    | With no webhook secret the endpoint refuses every delivery, because it
    | cannot tell RevenueCat apart from anybody who found the URL and an
    | endpoint that queues a tier change must not accept an unauthenticated
    | one. With no API key the authoritative read raises rather than answering
    | "nothing is owed", which would revoke every paying team. Neither has a
    | fallback: a default would be either a secret in a public repository or a
    | value that authenticates as nobody.
    |
    | 'operation_budget_seconds' bounds the WHOLE retried read, not one call: a
    | per-call timeout sized against a wall breaks the moment anything retries.
    |
    | 'accept_sandbox' is whether this deployment may act on sandbox purchases
    | at all. FALSE in production, always: a sandbox purchase granting a real
    | paid tier is money out of the door, and a store's sandbox is trivially
    | reachable by anybody with a developer account. It only WIDENS what an
    | inbound event is allowed to say; it is never read instead of it.
    |
    | 'reconcile' configures the SWEEP that heals a dropped webhook. Both rails
    | abandon a delivery (RevenueCat after five retries inside about three
    | hours, Stripe after roughly three days) and after that the drift is
    | permanent and silent, so `billing:reconcile` re-reads each rail and
    | corrects what moved. The package registers the schedule itself, under the
    | billing feature, because a rail that only heals when the adopter
    | remembered to schedule something is a rail that does not heal.
    |
    | THE DEFAULT IS DAILY, and that is a deliberate softening of the cadence
    | the application this rail came from runs. The sweep makes one
    | authoritative RevenueCat read per store subject per run, so hourly against
    | a large store fleet is an API bill an adopter never agreed to, and this
    | package ships the schedule whether or not they thought about it. Daily
    | still heals inside Stripe's three-day window; it can be a day behind a
    | store expiry. An adopter selling mostly through the stores should set this
    | to 'hourly', which is what heals inside the window the damage arrives in.
    |
    | The value is a frequency WORD from the list the reconciler's registration
    | recognises, or any cron expression, which is the escape hatch for a
    | cadence no word names (a staggered sweep, or four times a day at hours you
    | choose). A word that is not on the list and is not a valid cron expression
    | raises from `schedule:run` rather than silently never running.
    |
    | The registration carries `withoutOverlapping()` and `onOneServer()`.
    | onOneServer() is NOT fleet-wide protection on every cache store: it takes
    | a lock through the default cache, and the `file` and `array` stores both
    | implement locking LOCALLY (a file on that server's own disk, an array in
    | that process's own memory), so every server acquires its own lock and runs
    | its own sweep. Nothing raises and nothing warns. Point the default cache
    | at a shared store (redis, memcached, database, dynamodb) if one sweep per
    | fleet is what you need; otherwise expect one per server.

        | `magic_starter.notifications.external_id_prefix`, which defaults to
        | the same `user_`. Change one and change the other.
        |

        | Set this and a push carrying a deep link opens the right SCREEN in a
        | browser instead of the home page.
        |
        | It is needed because a browser reads `web_url` and nothing else. The
        | mobile clients navigate from the notification's custom data, and the
        | web one cannot: a click is handled by the service worker, which opens
        | the launch url as an ordinary page load, so no Dart is running yet to
        | read that data. OneSignal supplies the dashboard's Site URL when the
        | payload names no url, which is why the symptom is the home page in a
        | new tab rather than an error. Measured against a live deployment on
        | 2026-09-10; nothing reported a failure.
        |
        | {@see OneSignalChannel::applyWebUrl} joins this to the deep link the
        | notification already carries, so an application sets one value here
        | rather than composing an absolute url in every notification class. A
        | builder that sets `web_url` itself is always left alone.
        |
        | Absent means off, and off is the old behaviour rather than a broken
        | one: mobile keeps working exactly as before and web keeps landing on
        | the home page. Guessing an origin would be worse than not having one,
        | since `APP_URL` on an API-only deployment is the API host and would
        | send every web recipient somewhere the client is not served.

        | The endpoint lets a signed-in person page their OWN devices, so they
        | can find out whether push reaches the phone in their hand before an
        | incident rather than during one. It takes no recipient: the target is
        | derived from the Sanctum session.
        |
        | OFF, and an absent key is off too. Everything the endpoint does is
        | make the platform emit a real push because a client asked it to, and
        | that is a capability to switch on deliberately once an application
        | actually offers the button, not one to have live and reachable by
        | anything holding a token from the day the package is installed.
        | Absence has to mean off for the same reason: `mergeConfigFrom` is a
        | shallow merge, so a config published before this key existed carries
        | an `onesignal` block with no switch in it, and an upgrade must not
        | turn an outbound send on for an adopter who never asked for one.
        |
        | While it is off the route is still registered (under the
        | `notifications` feature, as before) and answers 501: the server does
        | not offer this functionality. That is deliberately none of the other
        | three answers this endpoint gives. 403 means the caller may not, 409
        | means push is not provisioned on this deployment, and 404 means the
        | notifications feature is off entirely; a switched-off endpoint is
        | none of those, and reusing one of them would send whoever hits it
        | looking for the wrong thing.
        |
        | TURNING IT ON TAKES BOTH HALVES. The Flutter client carries the same
        | switch, `notifications.push.self_test_enabled` in the magic
        | notifications config, also off by default, and its push channel
        | reports itself unavailable and posts nothing while that one is off.
        | Setting only this key leaves a live endpoint no client calls; setting
        | only the client's leaves a client posting requests that always 501.
        | Set both, and only once something needs the button.
