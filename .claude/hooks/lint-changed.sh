# Lint the file Claude just wrote, and report a failure instead of hiding it.
#
# `Backend (pint + tests)` is one of the required checks on this repository, so a style
# violation that reaches a push costs a CI round. This reports it at the moment it is written.
#
# Why a script rather than a settings one-liner: a JSON-escaped command is where a malformed
# settings file comes from, and a malformed one is skipped silently in -p and CI runs.
#
# Why the linter call is not wrapped to discard stderr and swallow the exit code: a suppressed
# hook is indistinguishable from a hook that never fired.
#
# `set -e` is deliberately absent: the linter's nonzero exit is the case worth reporting, and
# -e would exit before the report is written. Every condition the hook cannot judge exits 0.
